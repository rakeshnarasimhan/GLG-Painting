  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
  <br>
  <p> <b> Question: Do you take care of covering all floors and furniture while you paint </b></br>
      Answer: We definitely bring drop cloths and cover the floor.  However,  moving furniture and protecting furniture is extra.  We recommend that the house owner move all furniture to the middle of the room and cover it if ceiling needs painting. 
  </p>
  <p> <b> Question: Do you bring your own material such as paint brushes, paint trays, rollers etc.? </b></br>
      Answer: Yes,  we bring all necessary material except the paint itself.  
  </p>
  <p> <b> Question: Do you buy the paint? </b></br>
      Answer: We do not buy the paint.  This is mainly because different customers prefer different paint companies and different grades of paint.
  </p>
  <p> <b> Question: Can I pay for the paint but have you pick it up? </b></br>
      Answer: Certainly.  If you tell me a local store close to your house, I can pick up the paint for you.  In fact, the best option is to create an account at the paint store for the job so that you can pay for it directly and I can go and pick up extra gallons if necessary of the already decided paint colors.
