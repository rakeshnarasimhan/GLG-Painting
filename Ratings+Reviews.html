   <b> Review #1 </b>
   My wife and I found our HOUSE PAINTER by accident, after calling 3 other local businesses (House painters) with no return calls, 
   and 1 that had a bait an switch coupon in local ad paper, he came out and gave us a price then 2 days later called and asked if 
   he could come out and give us a bid on painting our house, the wife told him he had already been out and don't bother calling back. 
   So a week later we are driving around town looking at homes with paint colors and saw a young man painting this home around the 
   corner from us, his name is Mario and his Company name is GLZ Painting. He called us when he said he would he came by the house 
   to get our color sample we wanted sent us to his paint store for trim colors and started the day he said and finished when he said 
   and he does all work alone, scrapping sanding etc. 5 stars all the way around. If you need your house painted in the greater Seattle area,
   call GLZ painting.

  <b> Review #2 </b>
  Mario just finished today painting my condo from top to bottom.  My place had not been painted
  properly for over 20 years. It has the high ceilings and needed lots of patching, sanding and re-texturing before he even started
  painting. He covered all the floors and misc stuff that needed to be protected thru out the entire job.The prep and painting
  was very well done and Mario was nice enough to help a color blind guy like myself pick some good colors to use. He
  was checking in with me on a regular basis to be sure everything was going well from my perspective. He showed up everyday on 
  time and ready to go. I would highly recommend you use GLZ Painting for any painting job you have, big or small. It was a 
  pleasure to do business with him.
